    <h2>The Light of Guru Nanak</h2>
    <p>Guru Nanak Dev Ji, the first Sikh Guru, illuminated the world with a doctrine rooted in love, humility, equality, and divine oneness. His message transcends religion, time, and geography — it speaks directly to the soul.</p>

    <h2>Universal Teachings</h2>
    <p>The foundation of this doctrine is simple yet profound: There is One Creator. We are all part of this sacred whole. No one is higher or lower. Service to others is service to the Divine.</p>

    <h2>Compassion & Truth</h2>
    <p>Guru Nanak taught that truthful living, honest work, and sharing with those in need are the pillars of a meaningful life. Compassion is not weakness — it is the highest strength.</p>

    <h2>A Call to Humanity</h2>
    <p>In a time of division and digital noise, this doctrine reminds us: return to simplicity, to spiritual clarity, to a life of contentment and care. Let us walk together — not as many tribes, but as One Light.</p>
